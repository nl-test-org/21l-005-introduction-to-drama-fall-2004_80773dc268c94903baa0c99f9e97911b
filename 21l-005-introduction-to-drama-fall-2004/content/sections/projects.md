During the fall of 2004, two sessions of 21L.005 were recorded especially for OpenCourseWare. These sessions feature students' discussion and performance of Luigi Pirandello's _Six Characters in Search of an Author_ and Bertolt Brecht's _Galileo_. The students formed two groups, the Pirandellans and Brechtians, each with the task of performing scenes from the selected play and leading the class discussion and analysis of that particular work. Below are links to the videos.
